    <h1>AKVANTA</h1>
    <nav><a href='Akvanta/index.html'>The Game </a><a href='http://github.com/Romulus10/Akvanta/wiki'>Wiki </a><a href='http://github.com/Romulus10/Akvanta/'>GitHub </a></nav>
    <main> Akvanta is a simple game written to run as an mobile web app. The game itself currently draws its inspiration from rougelike games
        that used ASCII-based graphics, displaying objects on the game maps through regular letters and characters. The game
        is located <a href='Akvanta/index.html'>here.</a>
        <strong>I would recommend reading the wiki's help page before playing.</strong>
        <h2>Screenshots</h2> None yet.
        <h2>Technical Details</h2> The UI for Akvanta was written by hand in HTML and CSS- and was my introduction to large coding projects in the
        two languages. The game core itself is written in JavaScript, which I had not worked in extensively before taking
        on this project. As a result, I'm sure I made a number of efficiency and efficacy mistakes as well as general breaches
        of convention. Feel free to fork the project on GitHub and file pull requests!
        <p>The wiki for the game, which includes gameplay instructions and code documentation, is located on <a href='http://github.com/Romulus10/Akvanta/wiki'>GitHub.</a>
            Or now, play a text-based RPG adventure still under development!
