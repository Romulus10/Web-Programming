# Django Web Framework
## Overview
The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines - the idea is to get as much in-depth functionality as possible with as little conflict as can be managed.
### Why Python?
Python is a tried-and-true scripting language created originally for the Amoeba operating system in 1991 by Guido van Rossum.

- Now used largely for *NIX application scripting.

### Language Features
* Benchmark analysis - Runtime speed comparable to C as data sets increase, with markedly lower memory requirements than Java or other full VM languages.

* Dynamically typed (duck typed)
* Automatic memory management
* Object-oriented
* Imperative
* Functional
* Procedural
* Semantically and stylistically agreed-upon "Pythonic" standard.
